# GifTastic
Using GIPHY API key to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs.

I created a GifTastic webpage of holiday gifs using the GIPHY API.

First I made an array of my favorite holidays and created buttons for each of them. 

When the user clicks on each button, 10 gifs are displayed on the screen of that holiday.

When the user clicks on the gif image it becomes an animated image, if the user clicks the gif image again the image will stay still and so on. 

User has the option to add any holiday they want on the Add Holiday to See Gif button and this will create a new button for their holiday that will be added to the list. 

The rating of each gif is displayed at the bottom of each gif image either labeling them g, pg, pg-13 etc.
